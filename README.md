# my-tools
A list of tools and resources I use. 

I categorize by tools, solutions, and other. **Tools** are generally software that is regularly used to create something. **Solutions** are generally project-specific, and usually a SaaS website or app. **Other** is a collection of themes, plugins, and other killer tools that aren't really stand-alone solutions or tools.

I have a Macbook Air that I use for the majority of my design and development work. But, I also use my personal computer on Windows 10 from time-to-time. I'll list apps I use that are either software for a specific OS [Mac] or [Windows], or if it's an online app [Web].
